Tensorflow version: 2.13.0

=>Aim: To train a model on the new dataset where we have a total of 250 instances for 5 gestures, and each instance contains 50 samples.


Model Architecture:

This is a sequential model with the following layers

1. Conv2D layer with 4 filters, kernel size of (3,1) and ReLU activation, with input shape of (n_timesteps, n_features).
2. Another Conv2D layer with 4 filters, kernel size of (3,1) and ReLU activation.
3. A dropout layer with 0.5 dropout rate.
4. A MaxPooling2D layer with pool size of (2,1).
5. A flatten layer.
6. A dense layer with 10 neurons and ReLU activation.
7. Another dense layer with n_outputs neurons and softmax activation.

The model is compiled with categorical cross-entropy loss, adam optimizer and accuracy metric. It is trained with the given trainX and trainy data for a specified number of epochs and batch size. Finally, the accuracy of the model is evaluated on the testX and testy data.

Accuracy= 94.000%
model .c file size = 157 KB
