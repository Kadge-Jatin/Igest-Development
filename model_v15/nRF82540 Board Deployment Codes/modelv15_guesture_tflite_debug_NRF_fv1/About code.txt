This Model is trained on ‘Conv 2D layer’ with 4 layers instead of 64 layers. In addition, only 10 neurons are used in dense layer instead of 100 neurons.

Tensorflow version: 2.13.0
TFLite version: 2.4.0-ALPHA

Error resolved:
●Error: “Didn't find op for builtin opcode 'CONV_2D' version '1'” 
●Firmware crashes after few minutes of code execution. The error is related to memory consumption by the code.
