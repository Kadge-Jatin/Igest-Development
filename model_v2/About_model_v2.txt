Tensorflow version: 2.13.0

Aim: To make a Deployment code for Arduino RP2040 to deploy ML model

Model Architecture:

The model is built on a Sequential Convolution Neural Network. The model will be a sequential model with the following layers:
1. Conv1D layer with 64 filters, kernel size of 3, and ReLU activation, with input shape of(n_timesteps, n_features).
2. Another Conv1D layer with 64 filters, kernel size of 3 and ReLU activation.
3. A dropout layer with 0.5 dropout rate.
4. A MaxPooling1D layer with pool size of 2.
5. A flatten layer.
6. A dense layer with 100 neurons and ReLU activation.
7. Another dense layer with n_outputs neurons and softmax activation.
The model is compiled with categorical cross-entropy loss, adam optimizer and accuracy metric.
The ML model has the input shape (1,10,6) which means 1 batch of 2d array of shape [10][6]. The model has the output shape (1,5) which means 1 batch of 5 elements.

Accuracy: 96.250%
